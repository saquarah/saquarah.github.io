        <h1>This is a large heading</h1>
        <h2>This is a heading as well, but smaller</h2>
        <h3>This, too, is a heading. But not as big as the last</h3>
        <h4>Alas, a heading, yet lacking in size</h4>
        <h5>Is it even possible to get smaller than this heading?</h5>
        <h6>It absolutely is</h6>
        <p>Here is some paragraph text for reference. Honestly, who would ever use a heading that small?</p>
        <p>I will now test out some ways we can get input from the user.</p>
        <input type="color"> color!<br>
        <input type="password"> password<br>
        <input type="url"> a url? <br>
        <input type="file"> a file! <br>
        <input type="checkbox"> <br>
    </body>
